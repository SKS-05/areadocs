Setting up a React project is straightforward, with options to clone an existing repository or use the `create-react-app` command. React requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher for optimal performance.

## Clone Repository
To get started, you can clone an existing React repository from GitHub.  

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Clone the React Repository">
    Begin by cloning the React project repository from GitHub:

    ```plaintext
    git clone https://github.com/user/react-project.git
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Access the Project Directory">
    After cloning, navigate into the project directory:

    ```plaintext
    cd react-project
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Install Required Dependencies">
    Install all necessary project dependencies using npm:

    <Note title="Important">
      Ensure you have Node.js installed before running this command.
    </Note>

    ```plaintext
    npm install
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Launch the Development Server">
    Start the development server to preview the project locally:

    ```plaintext
    npm start
    ```
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Quick Setup with npx

For a faster setup, use the `npx` command to create a new React project in one step:

```plaintext
npx create-react-app my-app
Creating a new React app in /path/to/your/project...
Cloning repository...
React app successfully created in /path/to/your/project!

Next steps:
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd my-app
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   npm start
