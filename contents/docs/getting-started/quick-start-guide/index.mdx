## Introduction

Building a recursive file system in React is essential for managing nested file structures efficiently. In this guide, we'll explore **recursive rendering**, **state management**, and **handling user interactions**. 

## Why Use a Recursive File System?

- 📂 **Handles nested structures** dynamically.
- 🔄 **Avoids hardcoded structures** and repetitive code.
- 🚀 **Optimized rendering** for performance.

<!-- Your blog markdown content -->
```

- Navigate to your local development server at `http://localhost:3000/blog`, where you will see your blog listed and sorted based on date. You can navigate to any blog to read it.


## 🏗 Setting Up the Project  

First, create a React project if you don’t have one:

```sh
npx create-react-app recursive-file-system
cd recursive-file-system
npm install
npm start
